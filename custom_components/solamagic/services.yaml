set_level:
  name: Set heater level
  description: |
    Set Solamagic heater power level to 0%, 33%, 66%, or 100%.

    Uses optimized two-phase protocol from Bluetooth sniffer analysis:
    - OFF (0%): Sends 0x00 0x21 commands only
    - ON (33%/66%/100%): Sends preparation (0x00 0xNN) then activation (0x01 0xNN) commands

    Optimized for Bluetooth proxy with proper timing and command count.
